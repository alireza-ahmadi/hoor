Hoor is a command line tool for adding Shamsi date feature to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io)
based websites.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of **Hoor** from [Releases](https://github.com/alireza-ahmadi/hoor/releases)
page. Also, if you already installed Golang toolchain, you can install hoor by running
the following command:

    go get -v github.com/alireza-ahmadi/hoor

## Usage

### IMPORTANT NOTE

**Current version is the first implementation of this utility, if you want to use
it, please make sure that you have a backup of your website first.**

Adding Shamsi date to all contents(or changing date format):

```sh
cd path/to/your/website
hoor
```

Adding Shamsi date to a single content:

```sh
cd path/to/your/website
hoor -i content/post/foobar.md
``` 

After adding Shamsi date to your contents, you can display Shamsi date in your posts
by using `{{ .Params.shamsidate }}` in your templates. The default format of shamsi
date is `d M yyyy` but you can change it by adding `shamsiDateFormat` configuration
option to your website config file.

```toml
baseURL = "http://alireza.es"
title = "بلاگ علیرضا احمدی"
theme = "vivid"
...
shamsiDateFormat = "d MMMماه yyyy"
...
[indexes]
   topic = "topics"
```

These are the available formmating options:

```

## How it works?

Due to the lack of plugin system in Hugo, there is no way to change date format
in the build process. I approached a simple solution for fixing this problem. By
running `hoor` command in your hugo site source code, **Hoor** will automatically
finds all of your posts/pages, read the gregorian date and convert it to a Shamsi(Jalali) 
date string then add the result to the [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/)
list. Afterwards, you can use that string as a [template variable](https://gohugo.io/templates/variables/).

#### So why shouldn't I generate that string manually, using a simple code editor?

Of course you can write it manually, but applying any change in date format would
be a great pain in future, by using **Hoor** you can change date format of 50+ files
in a few seconds while changing them manually would take so much longer. It's all
about maintainability.
